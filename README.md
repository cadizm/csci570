Collection of basic algorithms I found useful/interesting while taking
USC&#39;s grad course CSCI 570

Most of code is in python simply because I wanted to implement the algorithms
quickly with a minimum amount of fuss. Others are in C... the reason for which
I don't remember at the moment (took this class a while ago).

Maybe you might find them useful. Questions, comments, and suggestions are
[welcomed](http://cadizm.org).
